### Overview

This repository showcases the projects I developed during my Software Development Internship at Saiket Systems. The program was designed to build practical engineering skills by solving real-world problems.

Each project is a demonstration of hands-on experience in **modular programming**, **API consumption**, and the development of **user-interactive applications**. The focus was on writing clean, well-documented, and reliable code.
